Math.OEIS is a library module for interfacing with the Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
(http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/).

Building:

Get the dependencies

    Math.OEIS depends on the network and HTTP libraries.  On some platforms,
    these come bundled with GHC. On others, such as Debian/Ubuntu, you can get
    them from your package manager:

        apt-get install libghc6-network-dev

Build with Cabal:

    runhaskell Setup configure --prefix=$HOME
    runhaskell Setup build
    runhaskell Setup install --user

Building Haddock documentation (optional):

    runhaskell Setup haddock

    Once the documentation has been built, you can access it by
    pointing your browser to dist/doc/html/index.html.  It contains
    descriptions of the exported functions, in addition to many
    examples of the library's use.
